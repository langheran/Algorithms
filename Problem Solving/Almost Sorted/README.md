## Problem

[https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/almost-sorted/problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/almost-sorted/problem)

Given an array of integers, determine whether the array can be sorted in *ascending order* using only one of the following operations one time.

1. Swap two elements.
2. Reverse one sub-segment.

Determine whether one, both or neither of the operations will complete the task. If both work, choose *swap*. For instance, given an array  either swap the and , or reverse them to sort the array. Choose swap. The Output Format section below details requirements.

**Function Description**

Complete the *almostSorted* function in the editor below. It should print the results and return nothing.

almostSorted has the following parameter(s):

- *arr*: an array of integers

**Input Format**

The first line contains a single integer , the size of . 
The next line contains  space-separated integers  where .

**Constraints**

 

All  are distinct.

**Output Format**

1. If the array is already sorted, output *yes* on the first line. You do not need to output anything else.

2. If you can sort this array using one single operation (from the two permitted operations) then output *yes* on the first line and then:

    **a.** If elements can be swapped,  and , output *swap l r* in the second line. and  are the indices of the elements to be swapped, assuming that the array is indexed from  to .

    **b.** Otherwise, when reversing the segment , output *reverse l r* in the second line.  and  are the indices of the first and last elements of the subsequence to be reversed, assuming that the array is indexed from  to .

     represents the sub-sequence of the array, beginning at index  and ending at index , both inclusive.

If an array can be sorted by either swapping or reversing, choose swap.

1. If you cannot sort the array either way, output *no* on the first line.

**Sample Input 1**

```
2  
4 2  
```

**Sample Output 1**

```
yes  
swap 1 2
```

**Explanation 1**

You can either *swap(1, 2)* or *reverse(1, 2)*. You prefer swap.

**Sample Input 2**

```
3
3 1 2
```

**Sample Output 2**

```
no
```

**Explanation 2**

It is impossible to sort by one single operation.

**Sample Input 3**

```
6
1 5 4 3 2 6
```

**Sample Output 3**

```
yes
reverse 2 5
```

**Explanation 3**

You can reverse the sub-array *d[2...5] = "5 4 3 2"*, then the array becomes sorted.
