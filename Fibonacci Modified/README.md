## Problem

We define a *modified* [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) using the following definition:

> Given terms  and  where , term  is computed using the following relation:

For example, if  and ,

- ,
- ,
- ,
- and so on.

Given three integers, , , and , compute and print the  term of a *modified Fibonacci sequence*.

**Function Description**

Complete the *fibonacciModified* function in the editor below. It must return the number in the sequence.

fibonacciModified has the following parameter(s):

- *t1*: an integer
- *t2*: an integer
- *n*: an integer

**Note:** The value of  may far exceed the range of a -bit integer. Many submission languages have libraries that can handle such large results but, for those that don't (e.g., C++), you will need to compensate for the size of the result.

**Input Format**

A single line of three space-separated integers describing the respective values of , , and .

**Constraints**

- 
- 
-  may far exceed the range of a -bit integer.

**Output Format**

Print a single integer denoting the value of term  in the modified Fibonacci sequence where the first two terms are  and .

**Sample Input**

```
0 1 5
```

**Sample Output**

```
5
```

**Explanation**

The first two terms of the sequence are  and , which gives us a modified Fibonacci sequence of . Because , we return the  term.
